# Smart-Spinner
# Project A - ECE Technion - Smart Spinner

This project is a custom-built smart spinning top system designed to sense, analyze, and display rotational data in real time.
The system integrates a microcontroller, motion sensors, battery management, and wireless communication.

## Features
- Motion sensing using LSM6DSV (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- ESP32-S3 for wireless communication and data processing
- Rechargeable power system using 18650 batteries and a buck converter
- Optional remote-controlled mechanical extension via reserved hammer layout

## Goals
- Analyze spin speed and stability
- Visualize real-time motion data
- Build a modular, embedded system with future expansion in mind

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress â€” hardware assembly and firmware development underway.
